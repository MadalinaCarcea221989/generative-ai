This is useful when working with generative AI models, where enriching the descriptions can help improve the generated images or story contexts."

      "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight**: The sun emits all colors of light, including blue and red.\n",
      "2. **Atmospheric gases**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters various gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light.\n",
      "3. **Scattering**: As sunlight interacts with these tiny molecules, they scatter shorter wavelengths more efficiently than longer wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it in the late 19th century.\n",
      "4. **Blue light dominates**: Since blue light has a shorter wavelength (around 450-495 nanometers), it scatters much more easily and travels in all directions through the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from every part of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red light, on the other hand, has a longer wavelength (around 620-750 nanometers) and is scattered less. As a result, most of the red light passes straight through the atmosphere without being scattered as much, giving us the impression that the sun itself appears yellowish or orange due to the dominant presence of red light.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why not violet?**: You might wonder why the sky isn't purple, since violet light is even shorter in wavelength than blue. The reason lies in the way our eyes and brains process visual information. Violet light is scattered just as much as blue light, but it's absorbed by the ozone layer and other atmospheric gases to a greater extent, making blue the most apparent color.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Variations**: The exact shade of blue we see can vary depending on atmospheric conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clouds**: If there are clouds in the sky, they reflect sunlight and make the sky appear white or light gray.\n",
      "* **Pollution**: In cities with high levels of air pollution, the sky may take on a more hazy appearance due to particles scattering light in all directions.\n",
      "* **Time of day**: During sunrise and sunset, when the sun's rays pass through more atmosphere to reach us, the sky can appear orange or reddish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, next time you gaze up at that brilliant blue sky, remember the tiny molecules in our atmosphere doing their thing to make it possible!\n"
